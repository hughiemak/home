I am currently a Master student in Computer Science at ETH ZÃ¼rich. My research interests are the security of ML models, natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning (RL). 

Previously, I have completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I published a paper on Chinese-to-Cantonese neural machine translation as the first author and worked as a research intern on applying RL techniques to decode error correction codes at UCSD.

<!-- My interest is in Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL is a very elegant learning framework: It makes learning possible with simple reward signals. An advantage of this is that we do not have to manually construct a large amount of expert data, as often required in supervised learning, to train our agents. Instead, the agents are free to explore and come up with their solutions to the problem, possibly ones that are beyond our expectations. Besides RL, I am also interested in Natural Language Processing and have some related research experience. -->
