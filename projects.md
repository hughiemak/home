#### >> Deep Q-Learning in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

#### >> Low-Resource NMT System for Chinese-to-Cantonese Translation

{% include project-item.html 
content=
"A summer research internship in which I trained a Transformer for translating text from the written language (Chinese) to the spoken language (Cantonese) in Hong Kong. 

Parallel text resources in Chinese and Cantonese are scarce. In addition to collecting data from existing studies, I explored the possibility to increase the amount of training data by mining semantically similar sentences from parallel articles on Chinese and Cantonese Wikipedia.
