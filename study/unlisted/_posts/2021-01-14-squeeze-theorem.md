Let $I$
 be an interval having the point $a$ as a limit point. Let $g, f, h$ be functions defined on $I$, except possibly at $a$. Suppose that for every $x$ in $I$ not equal to $a$, we have

 $$g(x)≤f(x)≤h(x)$$

 and that 

 $$\lim_{x \rightarrow a}g(x) = \lim_{x \rightarrow a} h(x)=L$$

 Then $$\lim_{x\rightarrow a} f(x)=L$$
