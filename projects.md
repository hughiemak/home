#### >> Deep Q-Learning in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
I implemented the predator prey environment and independent DQNs to solve it. The predator prey environment is a sparse reward problem in which multiple agents have to capture a randomly moving prey by surrounding it in a toroidal grid world. 
<!-- Furthermore, I explored techniques such as action advising, hindsight experience replay, and random network distillation. -->

#### >> Solving Chomp with Policy Iteration

A personal project in which I applied policy iteration to recover the nontrivial winning strategy of the first player in [Chomp](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tom/Games/chomp.html){:target="_blank"} via self-play.

#### >> Low-Resource NMT system for Chinese-to-Cantonese Translation

A summer research internship in which I trained a Transformer for translating text from the written language (Chinese) to the spoken language (Cantonese) in Hong Kong. 

Parallel text resources in Chinese and Cantonese are scarce. In addition to collecting data from existing studies, I explored the possibility to increase the amount of training data by mining semantically similar sentences from parallel articles on Chinese and Cantonese Wikipedia.

#### >> Visualizing Linear and Logistic Regression

Interactive visualization of linear regression and logistic regression (motivated by tutorials from YouTube channel *The Coding Train*).

#### >> Real-Time Reversi Web App

A web app for playing Reversi built with Socket.IO. Players can create rooms/join rooms and play with others in real time over the internet. They can also chat with others and create accounts to view their game statistics.
