I am currently a Master student in Computer Science at ETH ZÃ¼rich. My research interests are reinforcement learning (RL), the security of ML models, natural language processing (NLP). 

Previously, I have completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I published a paper on Chinese-to-Cantonese neural machine translation as the first author and worked as a research intern on applying RL techniques to decode error correction codes at UCSD. During my master's studies, I published a paper on Federated Reinforcement Learning.
