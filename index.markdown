I am a final year student majoring in Computer Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. My interest lies in Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language Processing. I was supervised by [Prof. Tan Lee](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~tanlee/){:target="_blank"} in a summer research intership on neural machine translation. My final year project is on multi-agent reinforcement learning under the supervision of [Prof. Ho-fung Leung](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~lhf/){:target="_blank"}.
